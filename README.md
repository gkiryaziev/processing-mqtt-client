##	Processing 3 MQTT Client

I was interested to try to create something in a language Processing and I wrote a simple client application using MQTT protocol with my Raspberry Pi 2.

### Requirements:
```
[Processing 3](https://processing.org)
[G4P GUI Builder](http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4ptool/index.html)
[MQTT library](https://github.com/256dpi/processing-mqtt)
```

All necessary requirements you can install using the built-in Contribution Manager.
